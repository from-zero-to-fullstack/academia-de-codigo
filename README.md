# Project

From zero to FullStack - an unofficial course led by [Pedro Soares](https://github.com/pncsoares) with the aim of guiding and helping two friends to learn programming and become software developers.

# Introduction

The aim of this repository is to create and save the solutions of some `.js` exercises proposed by the Academia de CÃ³digo to access their Bootcamp. Their platform doesn't allow dinamic code and here I present you two options to solve the same problem: the one that their platform recognize and another improved code.
